DTD Parser, Version 2.0
=======================

The DTD Parser is a set of Java packages for exploring DTDs. For example, it
could be used by software that generates a database schema or Java classes from a
DTD. The following components are included:

* A set of classes that model DTDs as Java objects
* A DTD parser that creates DTD objects
* A DTD serializer that writes a DTD from DTD objects
* A sample application for generating Java classes from DTDs
* Complete source code
* Complete documentation

This is the 2.0 beta version. No changes between this and the release version are
anticipated.

The DTD parser, along with its source code, is freely available for use in both
commercial and non-commercial settings. It is not copyrighted and has absolutely
no warranty. Use it as you will.
