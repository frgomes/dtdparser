A DTD Parser retrieved from http://www.rpbourret.com/dtdparser/index.htm

This repository was created from the original DTDParser version 2.0 beta as made
available by the original author, Ronald Bourret. Some minor changes were applied
in order to compile properly on Java 5+ and produce pristine javadocs.

Below you see an almost intact copy of the above webpage:


DTD Parser
==========

The DTD Parser is a set of Java packages for exploring DTDs. For example, it
could be used by software that generates a database schema or Java classes from a
DTD. The following components are included:

* A set of classes that model DTDs as Java objects
* A DTD parser that creates DTD objects
* A DTD serializer that writes a DTD from DTD objects
* A sample application for generating Java classes from DTDs
* Complete source code
* Complete documentation

The DTD parser, is freely available for use in both commercial and non-commercial
settings. It is not copyrighted and has absolutely no warranty. Use it as you
will.
